Notes for Curtis Northcutt's RS1

Which paper you chose:
-----------------------
I chose the Bubble Cursor Paper.

I had no collaborators. 
-----------------------

The URL of your YouTube/Vimeo screencast:
-----------------------
Part 1: http://youtu.be/qRSXi19TS6c
Part 2: http://youtu.be/ZlaEJBx5odw
(2 minutes total, just had to split it up because I didnt want to click 343 times to get to other cursor at halfway point.)

Platform requirements for your software, like operating system, web browser, or language version:
-----------------------
Works best in Chrome. If Chrome doesn't work for you, use Firefox.

Instructions for running your software:
-----------------------
I would highly recommend just going to 
cgn.scripts.mit.edu/rs1
It works flawlessly online, but is buggier locally (probably because of my janky system). I recommend just going to cgn.scripts.mit.edu/rs1
I have also attached a zip of the files for you convenience if you wish to view it locally. It works the normal way.
Just unzip and view the index.html in Chrome.
